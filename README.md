# DocMind

**DocMind** is a modern web application built with [Next.js 13+](https://nextjs.org) designed to help users organize, document, and visualize ideas efficiently. It leverages **vector databases** for intelligent search and AI-powered retrieval, allowing seamless indexing and querying of documents, websites, and other resources.

## Features

* ‚ö° Built with Next.js 13+ App Router
* ü§ñ AI-powered retrieval and context-based chat
* üíæ Automatic document and website indexing
* üåê Supports multiple file types: PDF, CSV, images, and web pages
* üìù Fast and interactive frontend with Geist font
* üê≥ Local development with Docker Compose for vector DB
* üîë Secure API key support for OpenAI and Qdrant

## Project Flow & Logic

DocMind combines **document ingestion**, **vector embeddings**, and **AI-assisted querying**:

1. **Landing Page**: Users start with an introduction and call-to-action.
2. **Document Upload & Crawling**: Users can upload PDFs or crawl websites.

   * PDF/Text files are read and converted into embeddings.
   * Websites are crawled page by page, and textual content is indexed.
3. **Vector Database**:

   * Uses **Qdrant** as the vector database (local or cloud).
   * Documents and crawled content are stored with embeddings for fast semantic search.
4. **AI Chat**:

   * Users interact with an AI assistant that responds based on the **context of uploaded files or crawled pages**.
   * Streams real-time responses using OpenAI‚Äôs GPT models.
5. **Persistence**: All data persists in Qdrant, enabling fast search and context-based retrieval.

## Backend Overview

The backend is fully server-side and handles all core operations:

* **File Upload & Indexing** (`/api/ingest`):

  * Accepts files (PDF, CSV, etc.) and converts content into embeddings.
  * Stores documents in Qdrant for retrieval.

* **Website Crawling & Indexing** (`/api/crawl`):

  * Crawls pages from a given URL.
  * Extracts textual content and indexes it in Qdrant.

* **AI Chat** (`/api/chat`):

  * Receives user messages and context from indexed documents.
  * Generates AI responses via OpenAI‚Äôs GPT models.
  * Streams responses in real-time to the frontend.

* **Vector Store Integration**:

  * Uses [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) with `OpenAIEmbeddings` and `QdrantVectorStore`.
  * Provides a retriever interface to query top-K relevant chunks for AI responses.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18+
* [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) v8+
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for local Qdrant vector DB)

---

### Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mantu01/doc-mind
cd docmind
pnpm install
```

---

### Configuration

DocMind requires a vector database connection. You can choose **local** or **cloud-hosted** Qdrant.

#### 1. Local Qdrant via Docker Compose

1. Ensure Docker is running.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update as needed.
3. Start Qdrant:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

4. The app will connect to Qdrant at `http://localhost:6333` by default.

#### 2. Cloud Vector DB

1. Obtain your cloud Qdrant or other vector DB URL.
2. Set environment variables in `.env`:

```
QDRANT_URL=https://<your-cloud-vector-db-endpoint>
QDRANT_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

### Running Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view DocMind.
